## Hi! I'm Tejal ðŸ‘¾

I manage data and newsroom products at The Baltimore Banner. Previously, I studied a mishmash of journalism and computer science at Columbia, MIT, and BITS Pilani.

I write data stories on technology, politics and cities, and speak three human and five beep-boop languages. 

My work focuses on the intersection of journalism, design, and technology, which involves reporting data stories, creating interactive graphics and building visual products that shape reader perception. More on my portfolio: [tejalwakchoure.github.io](https://tejalwakchoure.github.io/) âš¡
