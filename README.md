## Hi! I'm Tejal. ðŸ‘¾

I'm a product manager at The Baltimore Banner and a graduate of Columbia's Lede Program for data journalism. Previously, I researched computational journalism at MIT and studied computer science at BITS Pilani. I write data stories on technology, politics and cities, and speak three human and five beep-boop languages. 

My work focuses on the intersection of journalism, design, and technology, which involves reporting data stories, creating interactive graphics and building visual products that shape reader perception. More on my portfolio: [tejalwakchoure.github.io](https://tejalwakchoure.github.io/) âš¡
